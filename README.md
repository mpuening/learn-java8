Learn Java 8
============

[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/mpuening/learn-java8/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mpuening/learn-java8/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

This project contains test cases that I made for me to learn some of the new Java 8 features.

It serves the purpose for me to have examples to reference for various APIs.

It now also includes examples of APIs that appeared before Java 8.

* Lambdas
* Stream API
* Date & Time API
* Optional API
* Default Interface Methods
* Nashorn JavaScript
* Service Providers (since Java 6)
* XSLT
